🚀 Day 14 of #100DaysOfCode

Today was all about polishing and progressing the real-time chat app I'm building! Here's what I achieved:

🛠️ Bug Fixes & Features

✅ Resolved message duplication issue in Socket.io

✅ Implemented real-time chat history from MongoDB 🎯

✅ Integrated timestamps and usernames with each message

✅ Added message alignment (sent: right, received: left) for a clean UX 💬

📦 Backend: Express.js + MongoDB + Socket.io
💻 Frontend: React + Tailwind + Socket.io-client

Next up: planning to integrate private messaging, typing indicators, and maybe even online presence tracking! 🔥
