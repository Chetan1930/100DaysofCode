## 📅 Update - Day 27: Starting Private Chat System

From today, I’m beginning work on implementing the **Private Chat System** for DevConnect.

🔐 Goals:
- Enable one-on-one conversations between users
- Show online/offline user status
- Build a clean UI to initiate and view private messages
- Ensure real-time updates using Socket.IO

Let’s build it one message at a time! 🚀
