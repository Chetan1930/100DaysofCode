# Day 15 - #100DaysOfCode

## âœ… Today's Progress

- Refactored UI logic in my React-based project.
- Fixed minor UI bugs and enhanced component reusability.
- Added structure and started writing the README file for the project.
- Revised core JavaScript concepts:
  - `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()` methods.
- Practiced DSA problems focused on:
  - Linked Lists
  - Recursion

## ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings

- Importance of clean, reusable code in large React applications.
- How small logic bugs can affect UI flow and component behavior.
- Strengthening base knowledge in JavaScript helps with debugging and optimization.
- Recursion is tricky but manageable with visual dry runs.

## ðŸ“… What's Next (Day 16 Plan)

- Continue working on the project README.
- Add toast notifications and protected routing (if needed).
- Solve 2â€“3 more DSA problems (Stacks + Linked List advanced).
- If time permits, explore useMemo and useCallback in React.
